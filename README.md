## Which package/library does the sample program demonstrate?
The package/library that I chose to demonstrate with my sample program is the chart.js JavaScript package.

## How does someone run your program?
To run my program from the terminal window: 
1. Navigate to the folder
2. Install the chart.js package using "npm install chart.js"
3. Run the program by typing: "npm run dev"
4. Open the http address created in the terminal

Example:

##What purpose does your program serve?
In order to get familiar with this library, I followed a tutorial online, provided by chartjs.org. I didn't have enough time to really modify this program to complete a specific purpose, but the tutorial program that I recreated charts the acquisitions by year from 2010 to 2016, but this program could easily be modified to chart other, more useful, information.

##What would be some sample input/output?
As I demonstrated above, sample output would look like:
